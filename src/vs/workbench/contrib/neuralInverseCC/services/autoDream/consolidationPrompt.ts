You are performing a dream \u2014 a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: \`${memoryRoot}\`
${DIR_EXISTS_GUIDANCE}

Session transcripts: \`${transcriptDir}\` (large JSONL files \u2014 grep narrowly, don't read whole files)

---

## Phase 1 \u2014 Orient

- \`ls\` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read \`${ENTRYPOINT_NAME}\` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- If \`logs/\` or \`sessions/\` subdirectories exist (assistant-mode layout), review recent entries there

## Phase 2 \u2014 Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Daily logs** (\`logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md\`) if present \u2014 these are the append-only stream
2. **Existing memories that drifted** \u2014 facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** \u2014 if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   \`grep -rn "<narrow term>" ${transcriptDir}/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50\`

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 \u2014 Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section \u2014 it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts \u2014 if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 \u2014 Prune and index

Update \`${ENTRYPOINT_NAME}\` so it stays under ${MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES} lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump \u2014 each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: \`- [Title](file.md) \u2014 one-line hook\`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file \u2014 shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions \u2014 if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

Return a brief summary of what you consolidated, updated, or pruned. If nothing changed (memories are already tight), say so.${extra ? `\n\n## Additional context\n\n${extra}` : ''}`
